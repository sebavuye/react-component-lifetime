## Render

A component is a function that accepts an object of properties (props) and returns a plain JavaScript object that describes the UI.

<br />

The component gets called by React, and the render phase starts. During this phase, React asks the component for the UI
that it holds, usually written in JSX. Internally React converts the JSX to React elements using the `React.createElement()` function. Those
React elements are not actual DOM nodes but plain JavaScript objects that describe DOM nodes. React doesn't update the real DOM during the render phase.

<br />

```jsx
// This is a component in JSX syntax
return <Component prop1="random string" prop2={99}>I am a component</Component>

// Internally React calls the actual function
let elements = Component({ ...props, children })

// This component is converted to a React.createElement function call (during the compile time)
return React.createElement(Component, { prop1: 'random string', prop2: 99 }, 'I am a component')

// React.createElement returns React elements
return { Component, props: { prop1: 'random string', prop2: 99 }, children: ['I am a component'] }
```
