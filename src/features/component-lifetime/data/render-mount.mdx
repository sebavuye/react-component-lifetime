## Render

A component accepts an object of properties (props) and returns a plain JavaScript object that describes the UI.

<br />

The component gets called by React, and the render phase starts. During this phase, React asks the component for the UI
that it holds. Internally React converts the JSX to React elements by using `React.createElement()` function. Those
React elements are just plain JavaScript objects that describe DOM nodes, but these objects aren't DOM nodes. React does
not add any of those to the DOM.

```jsx
// This is a component in JSX syntax
return <Component prop1="random string" prop2={99}>I am a component</Component>

// This component is converted to a React.createElement function call (during the compile time)
return React.createElement(MyComponent, { prop1: 'random string', prop2: 99 }, 'I am a component')

// React.createElement returns React elements
return { MyComponent, props: { prop1: 'random string', prop2: 99 }, children: ['I am a component'] }

// React calls the created element tree to render the DOM elements from it. (root.render(<MyComponent />))
let elements = MyComponent({ ...props, children })
```
