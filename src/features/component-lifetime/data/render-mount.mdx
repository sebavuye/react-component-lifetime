## Render

> Rendering is the moment a function component is called by React.

<br />

The React main phases include two subphases themself.

- render
- commit

<br />

The initial render phase starts when a React application is mounted. During this phase, React asks the components for
the UI that they hold, usually written in JSX. React begins with calling the root component[^1] and works its way down
to find all the components it needs to call. When React finishes calling all the components, it creates a JavaScript
object representing the DOM structure[^2].

[^1]:
    The root component is the component that is passed to the `ReactDom render` function
    `ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))`. Usually the root component is named `<App/>` (but not
    necesserilys)

[^2]: Often referred to as "virtual DOM". https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1066328666341294080?lang=en
