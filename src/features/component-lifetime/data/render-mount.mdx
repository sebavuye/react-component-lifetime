## Render

React `mount` and `update` phase has two phases. - Render - Commit

> "A component is a function that accepts an object of properties (props) and returns a plain JavaScript object that
> describes the UI."

<br />

The initial render phase starts when a React application is mounted. During this phase, React asks the components for the UI
that they hold, usually written in JSX (but not necessarily). React begins with calling the root component and works its
way down to find all the components it needs to call. When React finishes calling all the components, it creates a
JavaScript object representing the DOM structure.

Internally React converts the JSX to React elements using the `React.createElement()` function. Those React elements are
not actual DOM nodes but plain JavaScript objects that describe DOM nodes. React doesn't update the real DOM during the
render phase.

```jsx
// This is a component in JSX syntax
return (
  <Component prop1="random string" prop2={99}>
    I am a component
  </Component>
);

// Internally React calls the actual function
let elements = Component({ ...props, children });

// This component is converted to a React.createElement function call (during the compile time)
return React.createElement(Component, { prop1: "random string", prop2: 99 }, "I am a component");

// React.createElement returns React elements
return { Component, props: { prop1: "random string", prop2: 99 }, children: ["I am a component"] };
```
