## Render

React `mount` and `update` phase has two phases. - Render - Commit

The initial render phase starts when a React application is mounted. During this phase, React asks the components for
the UI that they hold, usually written in JSX (but not necessarily). React begins with calling the root component and
works its way down to find all the components it needs to call. When React finishes calling all the components, it
creates a JavaScript object representing the DOM structure. footnote: often refferred to as virtual DOM
