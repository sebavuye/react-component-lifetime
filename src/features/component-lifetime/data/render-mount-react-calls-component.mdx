## React calls the component

<br />

The root component gets called by React, and the render phase of the mount phase starts. During the render phase, React
asks the component for the UI that it holds, usually written in JSX (but not necessarily).

<br />

Internally React converts the JSX to React elements using the `React.createElement()` function. Those React elements are
not actual DOM nodes but plain JavaScript objects that describe DOM nodes. React doesn't interact with the actual DOM
during the renders phase, it only creates a JavaScript object that represents the actual DOM.

<br />

```jsx
// This is a component in JSX syntax
return (
  <Component prop1="random string" prop2={99}>
    I am a component
  </Component>
);

// Internally React calls the actual function
let elements = Component({ ...props, children });

// This component is converted to a React.createElement function call (during the compile time)
return React.createElement(Component, { prop1: "random string", prop2: 99 }, "I am a component");

// React.createElement returns React elements
return { Component, props: { prop1: "random string", prop2: 99 }, children: ["I am a component"] };
```
